This is a sampler utility that is intended to complement other tools in the Kokkos Tools set. This utility allows for sampling (rather than collecting) of profiling or debugging data gathered from a particular tool of the Kokkos Tools set. The Kokkos Tools user provides a sampling rate via the environment variable KOKKOS_TOOLS_SAMPLER_SKIP. It also has an environment variable for sampling probability, KOKKOS_TOOLS_SAMPLER_PROBABILITY that is a percent, taken as a float, between 0.0 and 100.0.

In order for the state of the sampled profiling and logging data in memory to be captured at the time of the utility's callback invocation, it might be important to enforce fences. However, this also means that there are more synchronization points compared with running the program without the tool.
This fencing behavior can be controlled by setting the environment variable `KOKKOS_TOOLS_GLOBALFENCES`. A non-zero value implies global fences on invocation of the tool. The default is not to introduce extra fences.
